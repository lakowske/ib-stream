- **Test Coverage:** Infrastructure, contract lookup, API functionality, configuration, caching
- **Error Handling:** Invalid symbols and security types covered

### Phase 3: Test Implementation ✅

```

#### BDD Framework Structure
**Status:** ✅ **Framework Created and Structured**

- **Feature Files:** 2 comprehensive Gherkin feature files created
- **Step Definitions:** Reusable step implementations for basic and contract operations
- **Test Configuration:** Pytest setup with proper fixtures and configuration discovery
- **Test Runner:** BDD execution framework with filtering and reporting

### Phase 4: Test Organization ✅

## System Validation Results

### Service Health ✅
```json
{
  "streaming_service": {
    "port": 8247,
    "client_id": 347,
    "status": "healthy",
    "tws_connected": true,
    "storage_health": "excellent"
  },
  "contracts_service": {
    "port": 8257, 
    "client_id": 348,
    "status": "healthy",
    "tws_connected": true,
    "cache_entries": 5
  }
}
```

### Contract Lookup Validation ✅
- **AAPL Stock:** Contract ID 265598, Exchange SMART
- **SPY ETF:** Contract ID 756733, Exchange SMART  
- **MNQ Future:** Contract ID 711280073, 5 contracts available
- **Invalid Symbols:** Proper error handling with 0 results

### API Functionality ✅
- **Health Endpoints:** Proper JSON responses with TWS connection status
- **Root Endpoints:** Complete API documentation and capabilities
- **Tick Types:** `["last", "all_last", "bid_ask", "mid_point"]` confirmed
- **Security Types:** All major types supported (STK, FUT, OPT, CASH, etc.)

### Configuration System ✅
- **Dynamic Ports:** Automatic discovery from `instance.env` working
- **Client IDs:** Unique MD5-based allocation confirmed (347, 348)
- **Environment Loading:** Proper configuration inheritance verified

## Test Execution Commands

### Primary Integration Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_system_integration.py -v

# Run integration tests directly
python tests/test_system_integration.py
```

### BDD Framework (Future Enhancement)
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd tests && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# BDD framework structure is ready for completion
python tests/test_bdd_runner.py --basic-only
```

## Success Criteria Achievement ✅

All original success criteria have been met:

1. **✅ Integration tests pass first** - 11/11 tests passing consistently
2. **✅ All basic infrastructure tests pass** - Services, TWS connections, APIs working
3. **✅ Contract lookup tests work for major asset classes** - Stocks, ETFs, futures tested
4. **✅ API endpoints respond correctly** - Health, documentation, error handling validated
5. **✅ Tests can be run repeatedly with consistent results** - Multiple execution cycles verified
6. **✅ Test framework is extensible for future enhancements** - BDD structure established

## Critical Implementation Success

### What Worked Well ✅
- **Live System Testing:** Tests against actual running services provide real validation
- **Configuration Discovery:** Automatic port/client ID detection ensures compatibility
