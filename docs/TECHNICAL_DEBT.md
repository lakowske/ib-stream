**Branch**: config-v2 ‚Üí main  
**Priority Classification**: High = Sprint, Medium = Next Quarter, Low = Backlog

## üìã Overview

This document tracks technical debt items identified during the configuration system v2.0 development and final code review. Items are prioritized based on impact to security, performance, and maintainability.

## üö® High Priority (Next Sprint)

### TD-001: Shell Injection Vulnerability
**Component**: CLI Tool (ib.py)  
**Impact**: Security Risk  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Medium

**Description**: Subprocess command handling in ib.py could potentially allow command injection if user input reaches supervisor commands without proper validation.

**Current Code**:
```python
# Line 756 in ib.py - potentially vulnerable
result = subprocess.run([cmd] + args, shell=False, ...)
```

**Remediation Plan**:
- Implement command whitelist validation
- Add input sanitization for arguments
- Create safe subprocess wrapper function
- Add comprehensive testing for injection attempts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Command validation prevents unauthorized commands
- [ ] Input sanitization blocks shell metacharacters
- [ ] Test suite covers injection attack vectors
- [ ] Security review confirms vulnerability resolved

### TD-002: Thread Safety in Global State
**Component**: Application Lifecycle (app_lifecycle.py)  
**Impact**: Stability Risk  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Risk**: Medium

**Description**: Global state variables lack proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially causing race conditions under concurrent access.

**Current Code**:
```python
# Global variables without synchronization
storage: Optional[MultiStorageV3] = None
background_manager: Optional[BackgroundStreamManager] = None
```

**Remediation Plan**:
- Implement thread-safe global state manager
- Add read/write locks for state access
- Review all global state access patterns
- Add concurrency testing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Global state access is thread-safe
- [ ] No race conditions under concurrent load
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] All global state operations are synchronized

### TD-003: Input Validation Enhancement
**Component**: CLI Tool (ib.py)  
**Impact**: Security Risk  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Risk**: Medium

**Description**: CLI command processing lacks comprehensive input validation, potentially allowing injection attacks.

**Remediation Plan**:
- Create centralized input validation class
- Implement regex-based validation patterns
- Add length limits and character restrictions
- Sanitize all user inputs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All CLI inputs are validated before processing
- [ ] Dangerous characters are properly sanitized
- [ ] Input length limits are enforced
- [ ] Validation errors provide clear feedback

**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Storage system initialization may leak resources if startup fails in certain error scenarios.

**Current Issue**:
- Incomplete cleanup in storage startup failure paths
- Potential memory leaks in background streaming
- File handles may not be properly closed

**Remediation Plan**:
- Add comprehensive cleanup in all error paths
- Implement resource tracking and monitoring
- Add resource leak detection in tests
- Review all async resource management

### TD-005: Configuration Hot-Reload Optimization
**Component**: Configuration System  
**Impact**: Performance  
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Configuration reloading could be optimized to reduce unnecessary processing and improve performance.

**Current Behavior**:
- Full configuration reload on any change
- Excessive logging during reload cycles
- No change detection optimization

**Remediation Plan**:
- Implement incremental configuration updates
- Add change detection and diff mechanisms
- Optimize logging for configuration changes
- Cache frequently accessed configuration values

### TD-006: Error Handling Standardization
**Component**: Multiple Components  
**Impact**: Maintainability  
**Effort**: 4-5 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Error handling patterns are inconsistent across components, making debugging and monitoring more difficult.

**Current Issues**:
- Inconsistent exception types and messages
- Varying log levels for similar errors
- No standardized error response format

**Remediation Plan**:
- Create standardized exception hierarchy
- Implement consistent error logging patterns
- Add structured error responses for APIs
- Create error handling best practices guide

## üéØ Low Priority (Backlog)

### TD-007: Performance Monitoring Integration
**Component**: All Services

**Effort**: 5-7 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Add comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics collection across all services.

**Scope**:
- Response time metrics for all endpoints
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Storage performance metrics  
- Configuration reload performance

### TD-008: Connection Pool Optimization
**Component**: TWS Connection Management  
**Impact**: Performance  
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Optimize TWS connection management with connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns.

**Improvements**:
- Connection pooling for TWS operations
- Circuit breaker for connection failures
- Automatic reconnection with backoff
- Connection health monitoring

### TD-009: Async/Await Pattern Consistency
**Component**: API Endpoints  
**Impact**: Performance  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Low

**Description**: Standardize async/await usage patterns across all API endpoints for consistent performance characteristics.

**Current Issues**:
- Mixed async/sync patterns in some endpoints
- Blocking operations in async contexts
- Inconsistent timeout handling

### TD-010: Test Coverage Enhancement
