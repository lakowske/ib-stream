I'd like you to look through ib-stream/ and ib-studies/ at the two different transport mechanisms SSE and Websockets and discover any unnecessary discrepencies between the messaging protocols used, or the endpoint layout, or the ability to send multiple types down a single stream. In essesnce I want you to look for inconsistencies between the two so that we can remove them and make it easier and less error prone for clients to develop and work with the API. This will also be the starting point towards better documentation of our improved interface. Please put your findings in ib-stream/docs/inconsistent-api-v1.md.

Now I'd like you to review the architect approvals and comments in @ib-stream/docs/inconsistent-api-v1.md and come up with two documents, a protocol.md document, which documents the consistent protocol used by the v2 ib-stream with both SSE and WebSocket, with sections for where SSE and WebSockets diverge. And I'd also like a ib-stream-v2-refactor.md document that details a plan for making the changes need to bring ib-stream into alignment with the suggestions approved and made in @ib-stream/docs/inconsistent-api-v1.md.
