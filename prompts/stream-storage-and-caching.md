Please review ib-stream/docs/ and come up with a plan to store streams to disk so the data can be cached and quickly retrieved. The idea is to allow ib-studies/ to read in data from a 24hr period or longer to generate statistical values that take in more than just the data that they have received since the study started running. The study may want from the beginning of the current new york session, or since midnight, or since the beginning of the week, month, etc... The study will want the prior data up to and including the live stream of the present data (most often), but sometimes for testing purposes (or other reasons), we may end the stream at some time in the past. So the queries will often look like (midnight, present), (yesterdays close, present), (start of the week, present), (start of new york session 7/9/2025, end of new york session 7/9/2025) <- testing/analysis. I'm interested in you creating options for storage format (e.g. json, protobuf, etc...) and indexing (json, yaml, postgres, etc...) the data stored on disk. The streams may be large, so some organization and indexing is needed to quickly seek out the data. Please put your plan and options into a document in ib-stream/docs/
